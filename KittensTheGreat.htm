		<h3>Story</h3><br>
		You are a Kitty, you want to be left alone. You HATE people. They've done some very bad things.<br>
		One of the worst things they've ever done, was vote against you One thousand, one hundred, and one times, in the most recent Ludum Dare theme voting.<br>
		Get them back now, travel to three different cities, and decimate the population. Then you can finally be <b>alone</b>.
		<h3>Controls</h3><br>
		Arrow Keys to move.<br> 
		All actions are explained on-screen. Basically keep moving and pressing X.<Br>
		Cmon its a board game. How hard could it be?<br>
		<h3>Background</h3><br>
		This game was made within 48 hours for <a href=http://www.ludumdare.com>Ludum Dare 21</a>. This was my fourth 48-hour game, and although I feel I wasted a lot of time, and could have made this into something much better, I feel satisfied I was able to finish in time.
